# MotoReMinder

### MotoReMinder is a universal application that will remind automobile owners when various maintenance intervals are passed based on mileage driven. If the user has access to a Bluetooth enabled OBD-II scanner and their car supports it, the mileage on the car will be automatically updated in the background and push-notifications will be sent to their device to remind them of the intervals coming up.

### Have a car and want to keep track?
* Windows: download windows release, extract to foler, run .exe file
* Android: download APK release, install APK
* If on anything else: we have a local web-app build available. Download the web release and run a local server within the folder downloaded. For reference: https://docs.flutter.dev/deployment/web#building-the-app-for-release

To Build: with the flutter SDK installed, clone repo into VSCode or other IDE, choose what virtual device to build onto, and run the default build. (MORE INFORMATION TO BE GIVEN AS NEEDED)

To give feedback to founding developers: email us at motoreminder@gmail.com with FEEDBACK as the first word in the subject line.

Software Development Model, and How to Contribute:
Sprint Time: 1 week.
Sprint Deliverable: Annotated Portfolio of work done that sprint.
Scrum Standups: Every Mon and Wed, describe 3 things: 
* What you're working on, 
* What's going well, 
* What's not going well.

After Every Standup, address any concerns brought up with "What's Not Going Well."

Every friday, we'll do a text version of the standup.

After Standups we will do code review.

How to add to the KANBAN board: At any time if a member thinks of something to be worked on they will add it to the NEW section. These will include User Story based feature requests as well as bug reports. NEW issues will be labeled according to project label standards to be finalized soon.
 
How to determine if Backlog or Ready: During bi-weekly meetings, NEW issues will be sorted by group consensus and labeled according to effort level.
 
How to move to In Progress: Any time a member is actively developing for an issue it will be IN PROGRESS on the KANBAN board.
 
How to move to In Review: Any time a member feels like the issue has been resolved by their inputs they will move to IN REVIEW.
 
How review is done: After Scrum Standups, group will review issues in IN REVIEW as well as consulting with stakeholders IE Jody Paul. If standards met, move to DONE, otherwise move back to READY
 
When to move to DONE: When reviewed, tests passed, and stakeholder approved we will move to DONE.
 
Tests and Code are done same day and should be considered part of same issue on board.

Code Review Standards:
* Compiles
* Commented and Documented for readability
* All existing tests passed
* Tests written for contribution
* External Contributions Attributed
